## 📋 What You Need Before Deploying:

### 1. MetaMask Setup
- Install MetaMask: https://metamask.io/

You need at least 0.01 ETH for deployment.

### 3. Export Your Private Key

2. Click on your account (top right)
3. Go to "Account Details"

5. Enter your MetaMask password
6. Copy the private key (64 characters, no spaces)

### 4. Update .env File
1. Open `blockchain/.env` file
2. Replace `your_private_key_here` with your actual private key:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=abc123def456...  (64 characters, no 0x prefix)
```
3. Save the file

## 🎯 Deploy Command

```

## 📝 After Deployment

## ⚡ Alternative: Use Thirdweb Deploy (Easier!)

If you want a simpler deployment with a nice UI:

```bash
cd blockchain
npx thirdweb deploy
```

This will:
- Open a browser interface
- Let you deploy with MetaMask (no private key needed)
- Provide a dashboard to interact with your contract
